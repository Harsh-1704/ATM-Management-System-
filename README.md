# ATM-Management-System-
ATM Management System is a Java-based application that simulates core ATM operations such as user authentication, balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, and transaction tracking using OOP concepts and database connectivity.

The ATM Management System is a Java-based application that simulates the basic operations of an Automated Teller Machine. It allows users to securely access their accounts and perform essential banking transactions such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, cash deposit, and transaction history viewing. The project focuses on applying core Java concepts and database integration to model a real-world banking system.


Features

- Balance inquiry
- Cash withdrawal with insufficient balance checks
- Cash deposit functionality
- Transaction history tracking
- Input validation and exception handling
- Modular and structured code using OOP principles





Technologies Used

- Java
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- MySQL / (based on implementation)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Exception Handling

How it Work's
